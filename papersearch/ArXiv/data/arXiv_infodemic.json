It is thus necessary to combat the infodemic and\nmake a concerted effort to confront COVID-19 and mitigate its negative impact\nin all walks of life when saving lives and maintaining normal orders during\ntrying times. In this position paper of combating the COVID-19 infodemic, we\nillustrate its need by providing real-world examples of rampant conspiracy\ntheories, misinformation, and various types of scams that take advantage of\nhuman kindness, fear, and ignorance.

Based on\nresponses gathered from over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a\nstrong association between perceived believability of misinformation and\nvaccination hesitancy. Additionally, our study shows that only half of the\nonline users exposed to rumors might have seen the fact-checked information.\nMoreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of individuals\nconsidered these rumors believable. Our survey also shows that poorer regions\nare more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation.

Trolls, poised\nto disrupt the online discourse and spread disinformation, quickly seized the\nabsence of a credible response to COVID-19 and created a COVID-19 infodemic by\npromulgating dubious content on Twitter. To counter the COVID-19 infodemic, the\nTrollHunter leverages a unique linguistic analysis of a multi-dimensional set\nof Twitter content features to detect whether or not a tweet was meant to\ntroll. TrollHunter achieved 98.5% accuracy, 75.4% precision and 69.8% recall\nover a dataset of 1.3 million tweets. Without a final resolution of the\npandemic in sight, it is unlikely that the trolls will go away, although they\nmight be forced to evade automated hunting. To explore the plausibility of this\nstrategy, we developed and tested an adversarial machine learning mechanism\ncalled TrollHunter-Evader. TrollHunter-Evader employs a Test Time Evasion (TTE)\napproach in a combination with a Markov chain-based mechanism to recycle\noriginally trolling tweets.

On the contrary, infodemics of\nmisinformation can be a risk as it has occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nemerging fragility or robustness of the system will depend on how this complex\nnetwork of systems is governed. Future societal systems will not be only\nmultiscale in terms of the social dimension, but also in the temporality.\nNecessary and proper prevention and response systems based on complexity, ethic\nand multi-scale governance will be required. Real-time response systems are the\nbasis for resilience to be the foundation of robust societies. A top-down\napproach led by Governmental organs for managing humandemics is not sufficient\nand may be only effective if policies are very restrictive and their efficacy\ndepends not only in the measures implemented but also on the dynamics of the\npolicies and the population perception and compliance. This top-down approach\nis even weaker if there is not national and international coordination.\nCoordinating top-down agencies with bottom-up constructs will be the design\nprinciple.
