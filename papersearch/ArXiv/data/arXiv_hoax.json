Social network sites (SNSs) have\nrevolutionized the way in which information is spread by allowing users to\nfreely share content. As a consequence, SNSs are also increasingly used as\nvectors for the diffusion of misinformation and hoaxes. The amount of\ndisseminated information and the rapidity of its diffusion make it practically\nimpossible to assess reliability in a timely manner, highlighting the need for\nautomatic hoax detection systems.\n  As a contribution towards this objective, we show that Facebook posts can be\nclassified with high accuracy as hoaxes or non-hoaxes on the basis of the users\nwho \"liked\" them. We present two classification techniques, one based on\nlogistic regression, the other on a novel adaptation of boolean crowdsourcing\nalgorithms. On a dataset consisting of 15,500 Facebook posts and 909,236 users,\nwe obtain classification accuracies exceeding 99% even when the training set\ncontains less than 1% of the posts. We further show that our techniques are\nrobust: they work even when we restrict our attention to the users who like\nboth hoax and non-hoax posts. These results suggest that mapping the diffusion\npattern of information can be a useful component of automatic hoax detection\nsystems.", "author": [{"name": "Eugenio Tacchini"}, {"name": "Gabriele Ballarin"}, {"name": "Marco L.
