Such narratives present claims to readers, who must\ndecide whether to accept the statements in the claims as facts. We point out\nthat this process requires establishing connections to moral values, since it\nhas been shown that human decision making is heavily dependent on them. A\nsimple example illustrating how this could be done is given, related to claims\nabout fraud in the US 2020 Presidential elections.", "author": {"name": "Daniel Schwabe"}, "arxiv:comment": {"@xmlns:arxiv": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "#text": "2 pages"}, "link": [{"@href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12262v2", "@rel": "alternate", "@type": "text/html"}, {"@title": "pdf", "@href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12262v2", "@rel": "related", "@type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv:primary_category": {"@xmlns:arxiv": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "@term": "cs.CY", "@scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "category": {"@term": "cs.CY", "@scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.15165v1", "updated": "2021-05-31T17:13:47Z", "published": "2021-05-31T17:13:47Z", "title": "Multimodal Detection of Information Disorder from Social Media", "summary": "Social media is accompanied by an increasing proportion of content that\nprovides fake information or misleading content, known as information disorder.\nIn this paper, we study the problem of multimodal fake news detection on a\nlargescale multimodal dataset.

The wide\nspread of disinformation and fake news can cause detrimental societal effects.\nDespite the recent progress in detecting disinformation and fake news, it is\nstill non-trivial due to its complexity, diversity, multi-modality, and costs\nof fact-checking or annotation. The goal of this chapter is to pave the way for\nappreciating the challenges and advancements via: (1) introducing the types of\ninformation disorder on social media and examine their differences and\nconnections; (2) describing important and emerging tasks to combat\ndisinformation for characterization, detection and attribution; and (3)\ndiscussing a weak supervision approach to detect disinformation with limited\nlabeled data. We then provide an overview of the chapters in this book that\nrepresent the recent advancements in three related parts: (1) user engagements\nin the dissemination of information disorder; (2) techniques on detecting and\nmitigating disinformation; and (3) trending issues such as ethics, blockchain,\nclickbaits, etc. We hope this book to be a convenient entry point for\nresearchers, practitioners, and students to understand the problems and\nchallenges, learn state-of-the-art solutions for their specific needs, and\nquickly identify new research problems in their domains.", "author": [{"name": "Kai Shu"}, {"name": "Suhang Wang"}, {"name": "Dongwon Lee"}, {"name": "Huan Liu"}], "arxiv:comment": {"@xmlns:arxiv": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "#text": "Submitted as an introductory chapter for the edited book on \"Fake\n  News, Disinformation, and Misinformation in Social Media- Emerging Research\n  Challenges and Opportunities\", Springer Press"}, "link": [{"@href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00623v1", "@rel": "alternate", "@type": "text/html"}, {"@title": "pdf", "@href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00623v1", "@rel": "related", "@type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv:primary_category": {"@xmlns:arxiv": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "@term": "cs.SI", "@scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "category": [{"@term": "cs.SI", "@scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, {"@term": "cs.CL", "@scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, {"@term": "H.2.8", "@scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, {"@term": "H.2.8", "@scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11302v1", "updated": "2020-07-22T09:43:43Z", "published": "2020-07-22T09:43:43Z", "title": "Information disorders on Italian Facebook during COVID-19 infodemic", "summary": "In this work we carry out an exploratory analysis of online conversations on\nthe Italian Facebook during the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

We collected over 1.5 M posts in Italian language and related to\nCOVID-19, shared by nearly 80k public pages and groups for a period of four\nmonths since January 2020. Overall, we find that potentially harmful content\nshared by unreliable sources is substantially negligible compared to\ntraditional news websites, and that discussions over controversial topics has a\nlimited engagement w.r.t to the pandemic in general.
